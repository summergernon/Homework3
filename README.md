#PyBank

I created a Python script that analyzed financial records ('budget_data_1.csv' and 'budget_data_2.csv'). The script analyzes the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period

* The average change in revenue between months over the entire period

* The greatest increase in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period


#PyParagraph

I created a Python script to do the following with any text input:

  * Approximate word count

  * Approximate sentence count

  * Approximate letter count (per word)

  * Average sentence length (in words)
